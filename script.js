🌟 APP: Tip Calculator

These are the 3 functions you must use 👇
=========================================
calculateBill()
increasePeople()
decreasePeople()

These functions are hard coded in the HTML. So, you can't change their names.

These are all the DIV ID's you're gonna need access to 👇
========================================================
#1 ID 👉 'billTotalInput' = User input for bill total
#2 ID 👉 'tipInput' = User input for tip
#3 ID 👉 'numberOfPeople' = Current number of people you're splitting the bill between
#4 ID 👉 'perPersonTotal' = Total dollar value owed per person
*/

// bill input, tip input, number of people div, and per person total div

    // calculate the total (tip amount + bill)
    let totalAmount = Number(billAmount) + Number(tipAmount)
  
    // calculate the per person total (total divided by number of people)
    let eachAmount = (totalAmount / people).toFixed(2)

    // update the perPersonTotal on DOM & show it to user
